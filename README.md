# eclipse-jikespg

This is an Eclipse plugin that contributes syntax highlighting for jikespg grammars.
Make sure to open the file with the "Generic Editor" in order for the syntax highlighting to work.

This plugin can be installed using the following p2 site: https://datho7561.github.io/assets/p2/eclipse-jikespg .
Don't be fooled by the lack of a landing page at that address, it should work.
As you might be able to tell, the site is being updated manually,
so the version on the site might lag behind this repo.

This plugin uses a TextMate grammar and TM4E in order to provide syntax highlighting.
The grammar that this uses is the same one as for https://github.com/datho7561/vscode-jikespg .
